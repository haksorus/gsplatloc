# Parallel N-Dimensional Gaussian Rasterizer

Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "Feature 3DGS: Supercharging 3D Gaussian Splatting to Enable Distilled Feature Fields". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us. This part is developed based on [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization/tree/59f5f77e3ddbac3ed9db93ec2cfe99ed6c5d121d).
